    <h1><strong>Brookies (Brownie Cookies)</strong></h1>
        <img src="../images/brookie.jpeg" alt="A Brownie Cookie">
        <p>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for
    her birthday treat. Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe
    like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>

    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Prepare cookie layer: Beat butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg; beat
            until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is
            combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough evenly into the prepared baking dish; set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare brownie layer: Stir together sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a bowl; add eggs and beat well. Mix in cocoa

            spread to cover completely.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely
            before cutting into 20 bars.</li>
